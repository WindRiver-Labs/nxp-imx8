	# git whatchanged standard/base..


4. Boot Instructions
====================

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

4.1.1 Prepare Kernel, DTB, NFS and TFTP servers
-----------------------------------------------
The files in the following example can be found in <buildprj>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx8
and are copied to the export directory of the TFTP server.

4.1.2 Download kernel
---------------------

	# tftp $kernel_addr Image

4.1.3 Download DTB
------------------
For MCIMX8QM-MEK board:
	If you want to connect HDMI monitor to MIPI DSI1(J4) or DSI0(J9):
	# tftp $fdt_addr imx8qm-mek.dtb

	If you want to connect HDMI monitor to HDMI TX (J6):
	# tftp $fdt_addr imx8qm-mek-hdmi.dtb

	If you want to connect 2 HDMI monitors to HDMI TX (J6) and HDMI RX (J1):
	# tftp $fdt_addr imx8qm-mek-hdmi-in.dtb

	If you want to connect OLED screen to MIPI DSI1(J4) or DSI0(J9):
	# tftp $fdt_addr imx8qm-mek-dsi-rm67191.dtb

	If you want to connect OV5640 MIPI camera to MIPI CSI1(J5) or CSI0(J10):
	# tftp $fdt_addr imx8qm-mek-ov5640.dtb

4.1.4 Download and load firmware
--------------------------------

4.1.5 Set bootargs and boot the system
--------------------------------------

	# setenv bootargs console=<$console_port> root=/dev/nfs rw \
		 nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,v3,tcp \
		 ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off \
		 video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080-32@60
	# booti $kernel_addr - $fdt_addr

Note: for MCIMX8QM-MEK board, $kernel_addr="0x80280000", $fdt_addr="0x87000000"
	$console_port = "ttyLP0,115200"
      The kernel image will become larger if more kernel code is compiled into kernel image.
      So, please increase "fdt_addr" value by putting dtb file at higher address if you encounter with kernel booting failed.


5. Features
===========

5.1 HDMI
--------

To enable HDMI as the default framebuffer device, add:

	video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080-32@60

to the bootargs parameter of U-Boot.

5.2 USB feature
---------------

5.2.1 USB OTG Usage and verification
------------------------------------

1) Verify the OTG device mode

Plug in cable B and connect to the host machine.

Board configuration:

	# ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.10

Host machine configuration:

	# sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100
	# ping 192.168.1.10 -c 2
	PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=2.06 ms
	64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.286 ms
	...

2) Switch to OTG host mode

Replace cable B with cable A.

5.3 Static PM
-------------

The debug UART can be set as a wakeup source with:

For MCIMX8QM-MEK board:
	# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttyLP0/power/wakeup

	# echo mem > /sys/power/state

5.4 DMA & VPU
-------------

In wrlinux project, the version of sdma & vpu firmware which comes from linux-firmware
is 4.2, and there is a newer version 4.4 in the NXP i.mx SDK. Because of license issue,
the new version firmware can't be integrated into wrlinux product. If customer want to
use version 4.4 firmware, execute the following commands:

1) Download the firmware from URL:
	$ wget https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/NMG/MAD/YOCTO/firmware-imx-8.5.bin

2) Extract the firmware from the binary file:
	$ chmod 777 firmware-imx-8.5.bin
	$ ./firmware-imx-8.5.bin

3) You need to read and accept the EULA, and press y to continue. Then copy
firmwares to your rootfs:
	$ cd firmware-imx-8.5
	$ cp firmware/sdma/sdma-imx7d.bin path_to_your_rootfs/lib/firmware/sdma/
	$ cp firmware/vpu/vpu_fw_imx8_dec.bin path_to_your_rootfs/lib/firmware/vpu
	$ cp firmware/vpu/vpu_fw_imx8_enc.bin path_to_your_rootfs/lib/firmware/vpu

5.5 Graphics
------------

5.5.1 Xwayland
--------------
If you want to build a xwayland image, please follow the steps as below:

<1> Setup program and create a build directory by using the following arguments:

	--machines nxp-imx8 --distros wrlinux-graphics --dl-layers

<2> Setup environment and create a build directory:

	$ . ./environment-setup-<host>-wrlinuxsdk-linux
	$ . ./oe-init-build-env <build>

<3> Use the command as below to build a xwayland image:

	bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

5.5.2 GPU
---------
Because of the licesen issue, nxp-imx8 layer doesn't integrate imx8's GPU(GC7000Lite) or VPU
hardware acceleration related packages into WRlinux product. So, if customer wants
to run hardware graphic feature, please generate graphic with script scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh.
Detail steps as below:
<1> Download SDK package(5.10.9-1.0.0) with below command:
	# mkdir imx-yocto-bsp
	# cd imx-yocto-bsp
	# repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-gatesgarth -m imx-5.10.9-1.0.0.xml
	# repo sync

<2> Run script scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh and input correct parameter:
	# ./scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh -h
	 Usage: source generate-graphic-layer.sh
	    Optional parameters: [-s source-dir] [-d destination-dir] [-p platform-type] [-h]

	    * [-s source-dir]: Source directory where the graphic layer come from
	    * [-d destination-dir]: Destination directory where the graphic will be merged into
	    * [-p platform-type]: Indicate the platform where the graphic will be used
				  Value: imx8mq imx8qm imx8mm imx8qxp
	    * [-h]: help

	# ./scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh -s <nxp-sdk download directory>/imx-yocto-bsp/sources -d <wrlinux project directory>/layer/nxp-imx8/ -p <platform type>

<3> Read WARNING information carefully, and then input 'y' if you want to generate imx8-graphic layer

Use the command as below to add i.mx8 GPU graphic layer:

	bitbake-layers add-layer path_to_WRLinux_product/layers/nxp-imx8/imx8-graphic

<4> Following the instruction in Section 5.5.1 to build a xwayland image.

NOTE:

1) Now the GPU features are only for xwayland image, if building a sato image with
imx8-graphic layer, it will fail.

2) You must change the configuration to allow downloading of packages from the
internet. Change BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "1" to BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "0" in the file
${buildprj}/conf/local.conf.

3) Since some packages which are used to support the graphic feature in
nxp-imx8 is provided via binaries, when you build a nxp-imx8 project with
graphic support, there will be error info as below:
-----------ERROR--------------
ERROR: imx-gpu-viv-6.4.0.p2.0-aarch64-r0 do_unpack: To use 'imx-gpu-viv' you need to accept the Freescale EULA at 'path_to_WRLinux_product/layers/meta-freescale/EULA'. Please read it and in case you accept it, write: ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1" in your local.conf.
------------------------------
Please read the Freescale EULA file carefully, in case you accept it, write:
ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1" to your local.conf file to continue the building.

5.6 thermal
-----------

	To check current CPU temperature
	# cd /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0
	# cat temp
	51000
	# cat trip_point_0_type
	passive
	# cat trip_point_0_temp
	85000
	# cat trip_point_1_type
	critical
	# cat trip_point_1_temp
	95000

5.7 PCIe
--------

All the imx8 platforms support PCIe feature.
The PCIe bus is provided through the M.2 connector.

Can choose the below PCIe peripheral to validate:

	Intel Corporation Wireless 7265

Can validate using the following steps:

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

This will include the iwlwifi and mac80211 kernel modules in
the root file system.

Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-xxx

Copy relevant WiFi card firmware (Intel 7265 WiFi firmware: iwlwifi-7265D-10.ucode)
of to /lib/firmware of the target image.

Execute the following commands to validate the WiFi cards:

	# ifconfig wlan<idx> up
	# iw wlan<idx> scan
	# iw dev wlan<idx> connect <AP essid>
	# dhclient wlan<idx>
	# ping <AP address> -i wlan<idx> -c 5

NOTE: the PCIe driver does not support hotplug and suspend/resume.

5.8 FLEXCAN (MCIMX8QXP-MEK & MCIMX8QM-MEK)
---------------------------

Detail verification commands as below:

        # ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
        # ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
        # candump can0 &
        # cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
        # ip -d -s link show can0
        # ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, FLEXCAN feature works fine.

6. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

* boot kernel - the first kernel that you start and supports kexec, from U-Boot
	      for instance
* capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash

To build the boot kernel, enable kexec and kdump in your local.conf file:

	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/kexec feature/kdump"

6.1 kdump
---------

For the boot kernel:
To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, you need to pass the bootargs
argument "crashkernel" to the boot kernel as follow:

For MCIMX8QM-MEK board:
	crashkernel=512M

For the dump-capture kernel:
Before booting the dump-capture kernel, add "maxcpus=1 cma=128M" to the boot parameter.

NOTE: Use Image as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx8/ directory.

For more detailed info about kdump, refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.

7. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx8/wrlinux-image-<std-sato/std>-nxp-imx8.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user need to execute two steps:

1) Burn WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-<std-sato/std>-nxp-imx8.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

2) Prepare the bootloader image imx-boot-<$machine>-sd.bin. User can build
   a SDK to obtain the bootloader by executing the commands as below:

$repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-gatesgarth -m imx-5.10.9-1.0.0.xml
$repo sync
$DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland MACHINE=imx8qmmek source imx-setup-release.sh -b build-xwayland
$bitbake imx-boot

3) The imx-boot-<$machine>-sd.bin in SDK can be found in build-wayland/tmp/deploy/images/<$machine>/,
   and then use the command as below to burn it to SD card:

For MCIMX8QM-MEK board:

	# dd if=imx-boot-<$machine>-sd.bin-flash_spl of=/dev/your_sd_dev bs=1k seek=<x> conv=fsync

Note: $machine = "imx8qmmek", seek = "32"

4) Set environment variable for booting system

u-boot=>setenv fdt_file imx8qm-mek.dtb
u-boot=>setenv bootfile Image
u-boot=>setenv bootargs "root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rootwait rw rootdelay=5 console=${console},${baudrate} earlycon ip=dhcp"
u-boot=>setenv bootcmd "fatload mmc 1:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 1:1 $fdt_addr $fdt_file; booti $loadaddr - $fdt_addr";
u-boot=>run bootcmd

8. USB OTG
==========

This section only describs how to verify usb otg feature on MCIMX8QM-MEK board.

8.1 Host Mode
-------------

Connect usb disk with usb typec port(J17) on MCIMX8QM-MEK board.
Usb disk is detected, and then confirm the speed with command as below:

	# lsusb -t
	/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=/1p, 5000M
	    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 5000M
	/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=/1p, 480M

8.2 Device Mode
---------------

Connect the usb typec port(J17) to PC host, and then run below commands:

	# modprobe libcomposite

	# mkdir /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/g1
	# cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/g1

	# echo 0x1fc9 > idVendor
	# echo 0x12cf > idProduct

	# mkdir strings/0x409
	# echo 123456ABCDEF > strings/0x409/serialnumber
	# echo NXP > strings/0x409/manufacturer
	# echo "NXP iMX USB Composite Gadget" > strings/0x409/product

	# mkdir configs/c.1
	# mkdir configs/c.1/strings/0x409

	# echo 5 > configs/c.1/MaxPower
	# echo 0xc0 > configs/c.1/bmAttributes

	# mkdir functions/mass_storage.1
	# echo /dev/mmcblk1p1 > functions/mass_storage.1/lun.0/file
	# ln -s functions/mass_storage.1 configs/c.1/

	# mkdir functions/acm.1
	# ln -s functions/acm.1 configs/c.1

	# mkdir functions/ncm.1
	# echo 20 > functions/ncm.1/qmult
	# ln -s functions/ncm.1 configs/c.1

	# echo 5b110000.usb3 > UDC

After running above commands, MCIMX8QM-MEK board works as a usb mass storage device.
